<h3>Bridges between teeth</h3>
Crowns and bridges are a fixed solution to missing or damaged teeth. This restorative procedure uses prosthetic devices to return your smile to its natural state. A crown is used when the tooth structure is damaged or fractured. A bridge is used when one or more teeth are missing.<hr>

  <h3>Root canal</h3>
A root canal is a treatment used to repair and save a tooth that is badly decayed or becomes infected. During a root canal procedure, the nerve and pulp are removed and the inside of the tooth is cleaned and sealed. Without treatment, the tissue surrounding the tooth will become infected and abscesses may form.<hr>
</div>

  <h3>Temporary and permanent braces</h3>
Permanent retainers are sometimes options for patients who just completed significant orthodontic work, and need extra security while the teeth settle into their new locations. As the name implies, these retainers stay on your teeth at all times. Temporary or removable retainers Removable retainers are appliances that you wear in your mouth during treatment hours and remove to eat, brush your teeth or during other times that your orthodontist instructs. <hr>

  <h3>Filling</h3>
During filling procedures, dentists clean away the decay inside the cavity, usually with a drill, before filling it in. Fillings work by replacing the part of the tooth destroyed by tooth decay. The dentist molds them to match the shape of the surrounding tooth. <hr>

<div class="container" >
  <h3>Dentures</h3>
Dentures are artificial teeth and gums that are formed to your mouth and created by your dentists to replace lost or removed natural teeth. Dentures can either be full or partial, meaning they can either replace all teeth on either the top or bottom gum line, or just a few that are missing.<hr>
</div>

<div class="container" >
  <h3>Scaling</h3>
Scaling is a common dental procedure for patients with gum disease. This is a type of dental cleaning that reaches below the gumline to remove plaque buildup. The process of scaling and root planing the teeth is often referred to as a deep cleaning.<hr>
</div>

  <h3>Wisdom tooth extraction</h3>
When Is Removal Needed? When wisdom teeth cause problems, or X-rays show they might down the line, they need to come out. Other good reasons to take them out include: Damage to other teeth: That extra set of molars can push your other teeth around, causing mouth pain and bite problems.<hr> <br>
